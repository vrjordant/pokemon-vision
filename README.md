# pokemon-vision
I made this game in Java during the summer of 2016. I thought it would be a fun project because I love playing Pokemon, and I was interested in seeing how all the mechanics of the game work. I didn't know how to make an actual application, so this setup was the best I could come up with. All the game files are located in this one .jar file. To play the game, you need to download the .jar file and place it anywhere (like on your desktop). Then you need to open a command line like cmd on Windows or Terminal on Mac. Next, you have type 'java -jar INSERT-FILE-PATH-HERE', minus the quotation marks. Finally, you hit enter, and the game should start (hopefully)! There is a save feature implemented, so keep that in mind. I apologize if this is confusing to run. Once I get some more experience, I'll probably add some more content and organize this better. If you have any advice, I would really appreciate it! You can also ask me any questions if you're having trouble playing the game. Thanks!
